# Mars Data Challenge
 
 This assignments has two parts

# Part 1

In Part 1, I used Beautiful Soup and Splinter to scrape the news articles of the Red Planet Science (https://redplanetscience.com/). After scraping the data it was put into a dictionary.

# Part 2

In Part 2, using the same web scraping tools as above I scraped data from the Mars Temperature Data site. Once it was scraped the data was put into a Pandas Dataframe and some analaysis done in order to answer a few questions about Mars.

The final answers can be found in the part 2.
